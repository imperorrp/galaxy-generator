# Galactic Conquest - Current Progress

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation

- **[DONE]** Initialize React Project:
    - Used Vite: `npm create vite@latest galactic-conquest-r3f -- --template react` (Vite selected TypeScript, so it's `react-ts`).
    - Navigated into the project directory (`cd galactic-conquest-r3f`).
- **[DONE]** Install Core Dependencies:
    - `npm install` (for base dependencies after Vite setup).
    - `npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei`.
- **[DONE]** Setup Basic Directory Structure:
    - Created `src/components/scene`, `src/components/ui`, `src/contexts`, `src/hooks`, and `public/assets`.
- **[DONE]** Basic R3F Canvas Setup in `App.tsx`:
    - Rendered a `<Canvas>` with basic camera and `OrbitControls` from Drei.
    - Added a simple rotating cube to confirm setup.
    - Added basic ambient and point lights.
- **[DONE]** Implement Global Styles & CSS Reset:
    - Verified `src/index.css` meets requirements: `body, html { margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden; background: #000; }` and `canvas { display: block; }`.
- **[DONE]** Version Control:
    - User confirmed Git repository initialized and initial commit made.
- **[INFO]** `README-SPECS.md` and `PLAN.MD` are already populated and are being used as guides.

**All Phase 0 tasks are complete.**

## Phase 1: Galaxy View - Visualization

- **[DONE]** Implement galaxy data generation logic (formerly in `src/services/galaxyService.ts`, now refactored into `src/services/galaxyGenerationModules/`):
    - Created `src/types/galaxy.ts` for `StarData` and `PlanetData`.
    - Implemented `generateGalaxyData` (originally in `galaxyService.ts`, now part of `src/services/galaxyGenerationModules/`) to produce star positions, colors, and metadata.
- **[DONE]** Create `GalaxyView.tsx` component:
    - Uses `generateGalaxyData`.
    - Renders stars using `<points>` and `PointMaterial`.
- **[DONE]** Configure camera for galaxy view and integrate `GalaxyView.tsx` into `App.tsx`:
    - Removed placeholder cube from `App.tsx`.
    - Added `GalaxyView` to `App.tsx`.
    - Adjusted camera position, FOV, and `OrbitControls` for galaxy visualization.

**Next Steps (Continuing Phase 1):**
- **[DONE]** Implement basic star hover effect in `GalaxyView.tsx` (display star name).
- **[DONE]** Implement basic star selection state and display selected star info (placeholder HTML in `GalaxyView.tsx`).
- **[DONE]** Create a placeholder UI panel for selected star information (achieved with HTML element in `GalaxyView.tsx`).

**Next Steps (Continuing Phase 1):**
- **[DONE]** **[Optional]** Add background stars using Drei's `<Stars />` component for a distant starfield effect in `GalaxyView.tsx`.

**All Phase 1 tasks are complete.**

## Phase 2: System View - Visualization

- **[DONE]** Create `SystemView.tsx` component in `src/components/scene/`:
    - Takes `starData` as a prop.
    - Includes placeholders for the star and planets.
    - Will be conditionally rendered in `App.tsx` later.

**Next Steps (Continuing Phase 2):**
- **[DONE]** Create `PlanetMesh.tsx` component in `src/components/scene/`.
   - It takes `planetData` as a prop.
   - Renders the planet with basic geometry and material.
   - Implements orbital and axial rotation animation using `useFrame`.
   - Prepared for texture loading.
- **[DONE]** Integrate `PlanetMesh.tsx` into `SystemView.tsx`.

**Next Steps (Continuing Phase 2):**
- **[DONE]** Implement View Transition Logic:
   - Updated `App.tsx` for `currentView` state management (`galaxy` or `system`).
   - When a star is selected in `GalaxyView.tsx`, `currentView` is set to `'system'` and `selectedStar` data is stored.
   - `GalaxyView` or `SystemView` are conditionally rendered in `App.tsx` based on `currentView`.
   - Camera and `OrbitControls` are adjusted for the System View.
- **[DONE]** Implement "Back to Galaxy" functionality in `SystemView.tsx` and `App.tsx`.

**Next Steps (Continuing Phase 2):**
- **[DONE]** Create `SystemInfoDisplay.tsx` UI component in `src/components/ui/` for the selected system (displaying system name, planet details, and a "Back to Galaxy" button).
- **[DONE]** Integrate `SystemInfoDisplay.tsx` into `App.tsx` to be displayed when in System View.
- **[DONE]** Refactor `SystemView.tsx` to remove the current HTML "Back to Galaxy" button if it's moved to `SystemInfoDisplay.tsx`.

**All Phase 2 tasks are complete.**

## Phase 3: Enhancements & Important Systems

- **[INFO]** Feature Request Added: Multiple star textures for visual variety. This has been incorporated into `PLAN.md` and `README-SPECS.md` as part of Phase 3's "Galaxy Visual Polish" task.

**Next Steps (Start of Phase 3):**
1. Implement Galaxy Visual Polish:
    - **[DONE]** Implement star texture variety (code implemented; requires user to add `star_0.png`, `star_1.png`, `star_2.png` to `public/assets/textures/stars/`).
    - **[DONE]** Implement realistic spiral galaxy structure (central bulge, spiral arms, skewed radial distribution, logarithmic math, refined scatter, densified bulge, gradient coloring based on `new-galaxy-generation-ideas`).
    - **[DONE]** Add nebulae.
    - **[DONE]** Refine star appearance (general, beyond spiral structure).
    - **[REVIEWED]** Galaxy generation and visual appearance enhancements (spiral structure, star textures) are reflected in the codebase and this progress document.
    - **[DONE]** Add loosely scattered stars beyond the main galaxy disk.
    - **[DONE]** Implement globular clusters within and around the galaxy.
    - **[DONE]** Implement Dynamic Level of Detail (LoD) for star rendering:
        - The `useGalaxyLOD` hook manages automatic LOD switching for stars.
        - An Octree data structure (`PointOctree.ts`) is built using all star positions to efficiently find the star closest to the camera.
        - The distance to this nearest star determines the LOD level (0: Far, 1: Mid, 2: Near, 3: Very Near) based on predefined thresholds.
        - This LOD calculation, including the nearest star search via the Octree, is performed every 10 frames (`LOD_CALCULATION_INTERVAL_FRAMES`) to optimize performance.
        - If the Octree is unavailable (e.g., no stars provided) or no nearest star is found, the distance to the galaxy's origin is used as a fallback for LOD determination.
        - The system also supports manual LOD override capabilities.
    - **[DONE]** Implement Optimized Camera Mode (replaces High-Speed Rotation Mode, now externally controlled and monitors performance degradation) for performance adjustments.
    - **[INFO]** Refactored galaxy generation (formerly `galaxyService.ts`, now `src/services/galaxyGenerationModules/`) and LOD logic (`useGalaxyLOD.ts`) for improved modularity and clarity. The `galaxyGenerationModules` directory now contains specific modules for:
        - `globularClusterStarGenerator.ts`: Handles star generation for globular clusters.
        - `haloStarGenerator.ts`: Manages star generation in the galactic halo.
        - `mainGalaxyStarGenerator.ts`: Generates stars for the main galactic structures (bulge, bar, arms, disk).
        - `nameGenerator.ts`: Provides random name generation.
        - `outerDiskStarGenerator.ts`: Creates stars in the outer disk regions.
        - `planetGenerator.ts`: Generates planets for individual star systems.
    This refactoring also involved `starDataService.ts` (though this file seems to have been removed or was conceptual, the functionality is now integrated within the modules or `generateGalaxyData.ts`) for detailed star properties and `generationUtils.ts` (similarly, this seems to have been integrated or was conceptual) for common generation helper functions.
2. Define Important Systems (create data for key systems).
3. Implement Visual Distinction for Important Systems.
4. Implement Planet Texture Variety.
5. Improve UI Styling and Polish.
    - **[DONE]** Implement UI controls for toggling LoD modes and managing optimized camera mode (e.g., allowing user to request optimized state).

## Phase X: System View Enhancements (User Request)

- **[DONE]** Increased average number of planets per star:
    - Modified `generatePlanets` (within the refactored modules at `src/services/galaxyGenerationModules/`, formerly in `src/services/galaxyService.ts`) to generate more planets on average.
- **[DONE]** Increased visibility of celestial bodies in System View:
    - Increased star size in `src/components/scene/SystemView.tsx`.
    - Increased planet size in `src/components/scene/PlanetMesh.tsx`.
